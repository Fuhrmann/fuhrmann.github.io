Minidlna is a server software fully compliant with DLNA/UPnpP clientes. It means it'll server files to clients over network, for example, your TV. Here's a quick setup for a `docker-compose.yml` plug and play into your server:
``` yaml
version: '3'

services:
  dlna:
    image: vladgh/minidlna
    container_name: minidlna
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /mnt/movies:/media/movies
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      MINIDLNA_MEDIA_DIR: /media
      MINIDLNA_FRIENDLY_NAME: pc
```
> Notice that we're using a custom image from [vladgh](https://hub.docker.com/r/vladgh/minidlna), but feel free to choose any other image as you like (there's quite a [few](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=minidlna!). In this case I'm using one which offers support for `arm` since I'll be setting up this into my raspberry pi.

In case you want additional folders, you can setup like this:
``` yaml
    volumes:
      - /mnt/audio:/media/audio
      - /mnt/video:/media/video
    environment:
      MINIDLNA_MEDIA_DIR_1: /media/audio
      MINIDLNA_MEDIA_DIR_2: /media/video
      MINIDLNA_FRIENDLY_NAME: pc
```

After that start your container as usual:

```shell
user@raspberrypi [~/apps/minidlna]
$ docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
